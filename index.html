    <h1><strong> TESTIMONIES</strong></h1>
    <div class="test">
        <P>Dangote Construction had great input from the time we were initially selecting the land through
            the successful construction of our new building. We felt Dangote Construction was our partner
            in this endeavor and kept our best interests in mind. It was a pleasure working with you and your staff. One
            of the best testimonials I could give is that given the opportunity to build again, I would choose Dangote
            Construction"
